# UMAP & KDE Visualization

Visualize high-dimensional datasets in **2D and 3D** using **UMAP** and explore density patterns with **KDE**.  
The samples show visualizations of normal and abnormal heart rate variability features.
Outputs can also be saved as **GIFs** for dynamic 3D rotation and images from different angles of it.
